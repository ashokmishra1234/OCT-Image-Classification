# Image Classification Web App with ResNet & PyTorch

## Overview

This repository hosts a Streamlit-based web application for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the ResNet architecture. The model, implemented in PyTorch, is designed to classify medical images into one of four categories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL. The app provides an interactive user interface where users can upload images, and it displays the predicted class based on the processed input.

## Features

  * **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, allowing users to effortlessly upload images and see results.
  * **Robust Image Processing:** Leverages standard PyTorch transformations to preprocess images, ensuring consistent input for the model.
  * **State-of-the-Art Model:** Utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet18 architecture for accurate image classification.
  * **Error Handling:** Includes checks for the existence of the model file and gracefully handles prediction errors.
  * **Customizable:** Easy to update the model file path, adjust the number of classes, or extend the image transformation pipeline.

## Architecture and Technology Stack

  * **Front-End:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is used to build an interactive and responsive web UI.
  * **Back-End:** [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) powers the deep learning model, providing flexibility for customization and experimentation.
  * **Model Architecture:** The app employs a ResNet18 model, with a custom fully connected layer to output predictions for four target classes.
  * **Image Processing:** Uses [torchvision transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for resizing, normalizing, and converting images into tensors suitable for model inference.
  * **Dependencies:** Python 3.6+, PyTorch, Torchvision, Streamlit, and Pillow.
